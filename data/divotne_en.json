Neither a mother, nor myself, before becoming one. Someone who is extremely valuable and decisive and probably has nothing to do with my mothers’ role, and yet adorned by the procreation. There is both a mother and a not-mother in me. I contain motherhood and Her, and I don’t have to choose one, only balance, only master, only listen to my twoness."
