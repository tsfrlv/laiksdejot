      "p": "In „Prime Mover” choreographer duo Roosna & Flak deal with movement as cause and effect, freedom as well as inevitability. The audience is invited into a breathing, living universe with no real beginning and no real end, where everything is in motion and everything is connected to everything else, where thought and movement are the same and your wildest imaginations lurk just around the corner."

      "p": "Choreographer duo Roosna & Flak (Külli Roosna (Estonia) and Kenneth Flak (Norway)) have collaborated since 2008. Whether creating their own choreographies or dancing for others, they deal with the narratives and technologies of the body. They have explored a wide range of themes, including ecology, mythology, internet culture and totalitarianism. The core of their work is the dancing body’s possibilities and limitations, in a dialogue with the digital technologies and discourses that extend and counterpoint it."
