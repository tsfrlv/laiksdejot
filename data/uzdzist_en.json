      "p": "„Infade” is a performative installation concentrating on a very limited number of audience members at a time. Within the given framing every single audience member is invited to make individual choices and create his/her own experience. To take an intimate journey to a place where birth and death is one event, thus the line between both dissolves. “Infade” is a composition of natural physical movements in a destructively unnatural environment that has lost its previous meaning and has not yet transited into a new one."
