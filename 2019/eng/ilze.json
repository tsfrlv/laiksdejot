      "p": "JAM is an informal meeting in dance through Dance Improvisation and Contact Improvisation principles. There is always energy. It just needs to be used consciously. And then sources are revealed which can surprise you with power and content."

    {
      "p": "The warming up for JAM will be facilitated by Ilze Zirina who has been in the field since 1997 as a dancer at the Olga Zitluhina Dance Company. When the company stopped its activities in 2012, through various labyrinths, she came to a place that she loves – pedagogy. There she sharpens the skills of communication, technique and enjoys the creative processes."
