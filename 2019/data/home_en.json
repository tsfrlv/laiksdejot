      "p": "The festival “Laiks Dejot” started in 1998 as evenings of contemporary dance performances by Latvian choreographers. Over the years, it has managed to become the largest contemporary dance event in Latvia and has attracted a lot of interest from both professionals and the audience. This is proven by the range of countries that have been represented in the festival in the previous years – so far, “Laiks Dejot” has hosted artists from more than 30 different countries from Europe, Asia, Northern and Southern America."

      "p": "Each year the festival focuses and highlights a certain theme. The theme of “Laiks Dejot” 2019 is New Asian Dance, gathering artists from such countries as India, China, Singapore, USA/Philippines and Sri Lanka. The festival invites everyone to watch dance performances and attend workshops, discussions, improvisation sessions and other events."
