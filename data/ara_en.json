      "p": "The performance studies the modern man’s ability to go beyond the usual comfort zone in the name of a higher purpose. In the process of generating ideas, Henrik Ibsen’s drama „Brand” was taken as the literary source of the performance. It does not follow the storyline of the drama closely, yet the well-known Brand’s motto, „Be forgiven – if you were not able, but never – if you did not want”, has become the key driving force during the creation process of the performance."
