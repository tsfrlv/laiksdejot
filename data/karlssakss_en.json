      "p": "This workshop is meant for those who are interested in body and its biomechanical qualities. A workshop based on floorwork, partnering, improvisation and economic ways of using the body. A goal is set to perform a movement combination in the end of the workshop that focuses more on instincts and reactions rather than emotions or artistic expression. Hopefully the participant gets a confirmation that fighting the social comfort and sweeping sweat of one’s forehead after a physical effort, achieving a state of instinctive Me is possible."
