      "p": "I don’t teach any particular technique, but my classes consist of things that I have found important in my own work as a dancer and performer. I emphasize the wholeness of movement, which to me means taking advantage of the movement of the whole body, all of its different joints and vertebrae. This also involves recognizing where the movement starts from – where its impulse is. In my class we do the set material together and through the given structure I aim towards the individual freedom. We will play with the directions, the timing, the space and the dynamics of the movements. I want to teach dance that is ergonomic and pleasant to the body, although this does not mean it is easy!"

      "p": "I graduated 1996 from the Theatre Academy’s Dance Department in Helsinki and I have worked for the past twenty years mainly as a dancer, but also as a dance teacher and a choreographer. I have leaped from very physical dance pieces into conceptual – and improvisation – to dance theatre including Finnish folk dancing just to name a few of the styles. I have been a member of the Gruppen Fyra since 2003 and the company has its twentieth celebration year 2018."
