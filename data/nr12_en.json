      "p": "This is the first step of a creative process for a full-evening dance piece „Nr.12” with the vision of a beautiful, slightly patriotic, slightly ironic performance with a strong view of the narrow existence of a man in this world. In a world where we lose our intelligence, morality, in a world where these values remain secondary. In a world that has turned into a corrupt system against which to fight alone is completely futile. Human degradation, cruelty, stubbornness, fear and lack of belief in yourself, about tomorrow, and for every next step – this is our inevitable reality. Nevertheless, despite all of this, some of us manage to live a life saturated with joy and happiness."
