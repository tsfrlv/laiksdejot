      "p": "The inspiration for my work comes from summer in Vienna in 2017, where I was participating in an International Dance Festival ImPulsTanz by taking workshop by Ivo Dimchev. Besides the workshop I visited MUMOK – Museum of Modern Art where at that time the main focus was on the exhibition „WOMAN. FEMINIST AVANT-GARDE of the 1970s from the SAMMLUNG VERBUND Collection”. 300 artworks that show how women artists in the 1970s first began to collectively redefine their own image of women and expanding the male dominated avant-garde canon. The exhibition caused me great respect. How artists with very brave tools and often using strategies of irony could change the perspective of women. The exhibition was divided into four sections: 1) The Reduction to Mother, Housewife, and Wife; 2) Alter Ego: Masquerade, Parody, and Role plays; 3) Female Sexuality versus Objectification; 4) The Normativity of Beauty."

      "p": "As a starting point for my performance and the beginning of movement, I chose VALIE EXPORT artwork „The Birth Madonna” where I’m interested not only in a versatile image of women and what it means to be a woman today but also in the relationship between women and „the greatest invention of the industrial revolution” – the washing machine. Now, when time is being gained by using a washing machine, how do we spend it?"
