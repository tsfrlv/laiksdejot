In Agates Bankavas shy insolent piece about a woman as a fragile and dangerous creature on a mirror floor under a giant mirror vagina,hair plays an important role. In one episode, Agate pulls out the hair from her already damaged hairstyle, licks it, carefully clings to the mirror, and licks it again. All the attention is on one hair. Almost the same as if we found only one hair in a bowl of soup. Other ingredients may have a lot of invisible poisons, but the nausea accompanies that one hair that may have been washed with a very eco-shampoo.” – Inta Balode, „Diena”."
