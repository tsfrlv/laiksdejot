      "p": "I invite you to come to class with the belief that your body has all that it needs and that within the collective of the room, you expand your resources even further. You will have space to tap into your own “innate wisdom”, engaging with it through movement and breath. We’ll then move into more structured, direct improvisational scores for increasing awareness on all level. This will lead to a cumulative series of scores, moving across the floor to a sweet playlist, to uncover your most alive, rhythmic, and whole dancing self."
