      "p": "„Responsive Body Training” (RBT) is a dynamic system created by Roosna & Flak based on listening to oneself and the environment, training the dancer’s sensitivity and coordination as well as strength and stamina. The purpose is to develop an intelligent body which is strong, resilient, and open to internal as well as external impulses. RBT arose from a need to prepare the body and mind for a variety of challenges, and is constantly as a result of continuous practice and teaching."

      "p": "Choreographer duo Külli Roosna and Kenneth Flak have collaborated since 2008. Whether creating their own choreographies or dancing for others, they deal with the narratives and technologies of the body. They have explored a wide range of themes, including ecology, mythology, internet culture and totalitarianism. The core of their work is the dancing body’s possibilities and limitations, in a dialogue with the digital technologies and discourses that extend and counterpoint it."
