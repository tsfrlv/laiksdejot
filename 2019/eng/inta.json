      "p": "Inta Balode calls herself as a dance politician. She is a dance writer, curator, dramaturge and editor of www.journal.dance.lv. Inta holds MA degree in Theory of Culture; she acquired additional training in dance writing and management in the USA and Europe. Since 2004 Inta has been curating dance projects, including seminars for artists, journalists and managers and mini-festival called “New Dance in a New Place”. While working as a dance expert at the State Culture Capital Foundation and jury member at the annual theatre prize, she managed to lobby for the status of contemporary dance. Inta is a member of the Latvian Dance Council – a consultative group at the Ministry of Culture. As an outcome of caring about geographical, mental and emotional peripheries, in 2017 Inta together with co-thinkers from Latvia, France and Finland established an international non-profit organisation LAUKKU. Despite LAUKKU mood since summer 2018 Inta runs the Latvian Dance Information Centre. Inta was nominated for the Normunds Naumanis' Annual Art Criticism award (2018) and the Dance Award for „Investment in Dance Art” (2017–2018)."    }
