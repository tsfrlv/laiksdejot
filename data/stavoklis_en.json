      "p": "„State and Design” is a solo-piece that is performed through the hierarchy of the court room. The executive power and the suspects are presented by archetypes, the elements and artefacts are the evidence and in the witness stand sits a frightened artist. To find a proper solution they use paragraphs of rituals and archive of resurrected. Arguments and objections are mediated by legitimate physical hierarchy and shameless formality."
