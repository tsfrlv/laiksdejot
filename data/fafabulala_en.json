      "p": "The performance „Fafabulala” will tell you about the communication of three. As tolerant and democratic as are they, their way of expression is as subjective. The performance will remind us that there is no universal truth. The difference is in our attitude when we make dialogue with each other, bodily or verbally. In life (so as in art) everything is always changing – from tears to laughter, to horror and vice versa."
