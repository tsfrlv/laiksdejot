      "p": "Kristīne Brīniņa depicts a fictional event that details an accidental meeting between her and Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons in Boston. In the performance, with the help of this fantasy, Kristīne tells us about the similarities between the performing artist and the conductor and where the viewer plays the role of the orchestra. The choreographer is puzzled by the question as to what kind of movements are performed on a daily basis, as well as the „echo” they bring to society as a whole. As a means of expression, the choreographer uses the language of the conductor’s body, gestures and words, all of which are interspersed with her own expressions and thoughts."
