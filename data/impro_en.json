Do you want to live through the performance you saw yesterday? Do you want to understand who these bodies are, gathered for the „Laiks dejot” festival? Do you want to spend time together, avoiding empty small talk? Do you want to discover something new about yourself in movement?"

She started to engage in Contact Improvisation in 2000, when Benno Voorham and few more very special teachers started to guide Ilze through her CI journey. Since 2007 she is the facilitator of CI and Dance Improvisation at the Latvian Academy of Culture and occasionally develops herself at international experience exchange events."
