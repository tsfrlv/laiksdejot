Choreographer Santa Grīnfelde, set designer Krista Briģe and dance critic Inta Balode meet in a shared space and play with kinetic, visual, verbal, dramatic and sentimental aspects of movement and perception."

      "p": "In the middle of 2015 Santa decided to make a piece researching the meaning of movement. On February 1, 2016 within residency with Movement Research she performed the solo „Does she dance” in legendary Judson Church in NYC. After her residency in New York City Santa said: “New York is in me and it does not go away.” The performance started as a pure solo but now it continues as a solo by three, involving two regular observers, perceivers and interpreters: She dances, they stare. She dances, she frames, and she speaks. She dances, they think. Frames she dances within invite them to experience a relationship of change and permanence. How thick are the subjectivity bushes we are staring through, why do we stare and where is the pleasure of staring?"
