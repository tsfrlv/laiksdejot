      "p": "The Kandyan dance is a Sri Lankan dance form which was originally performed as a part of a healing communal ritual. After the island gained independence from the British, the form was 'canonised' and adapted for the proscenium stage, becoming a symbol of the national cultural heritage and identity."

      "p": "Venuri Perera (Sri Lanka) is one of a handful of artists exploring contemporary approaches to dance/performance making in Sri Lanka. She attunes with the woman's body through its thresholds of strength and vulnerability and her works have dealt with patriarchy, violent nationalism, colonial inheritance, class and the power dynamics of gaze. Primarily trained in Kandyan dance, she was a member of the acclaimed Chitrasena Dance Company for 13 years. In 2008, she completed her Post Graduate Certificate in Dance from Trinity Laban, London (Michelle Simone Award for ‘Outstanding Achievement in Choreography'). Since 2004, she has collaborated in performance projects in several countries. Venuri’s solo works have been invited to international festivals/symposiums in Europe, South and East Asia. She was curator of the Colombo Dance Platform 2016 and performing arts curator for the London South Bank Centre's Women of the World Festival Sri Lanka edition 2017. Venuri is a visiting lecturer at the University of Visual and Performing Arts."
