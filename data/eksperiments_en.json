      "p": "This performance is planned as a fun game, where the participants together with viewers will try to find a way to hug. Through movement the performers will live through many different relationship variations, where the active participants try to make contact, but can’t find common ground. To make a hug, you need at least two people. But what to do if there are three of you?"

    {
      "p": "The nature of this performance is interactive, where children are welcomed to join in and find out for themselves, which type of hug is the best one and the most pleasing from all the others. In this performance, dance will mix with songs, poetry, with music and laughter. The aim of this performance is to further the development of the little viewers’ associative thinking, as well as introduce the children to contemporary dance in a language they can understand. A touch is a very important component in the making of any relationship. Through a hug one can express love and care, and with that even heal."
