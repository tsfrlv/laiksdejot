      "p": "In „24h of Sleep” Kristīne Brīniņa explores different states of sleep as a possible refuge from the fear induced by the reality. The visitors are invited to spend 24 minutes in a sleep landscape and collectively imagine the end and the beginning of  this micro-world. „Now we will count to twelve and we will all keep still,” Pablo Neruda „Keeping Quiet”."

    {
      "p": "„She develops with „24h of Sleep” a symbolic work on violence. In front of only seven spectators, slumped on an old couch for 24 minutes, she simulates different states and positions of sleep while a loudspeaker diffuses an array of aggressive sounds: dogs barking, helicopter, gunshots, alarms... Difficult to not to see in it a representation of our own repression in the face of the violence suffered by migrants in their exile.” – Mathias Daval (FR), „I/O Gazette”"
