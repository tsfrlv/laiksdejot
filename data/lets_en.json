      "p": "It’s so nice that you are a couple. It’s wonderful to make something together then. Everything happens so easily and nicely by itself. You are dancers. You are superhumans you can do everything! And then there is a point where shit happens. Internal. In each of us. We are also human beings, besides the status of a professional dancer and choreographer – weak, fragile, happy, cheerful, sad, worried, exhausted, with or without money, with particular aims,in dead ends, with personal traumas, with a desire to stop dancing, and with divine inspiration to dance for all eternity, wanting to have a cat, no, we will not. Why do we need all of this, if we could live in a little house in the woods. Why are we together? What do you want from me? You don’t respect me, I am leaving?! I love you! You are hurting me. I understand you – you don’t understand anything. I love you… This work is likely to be a drama, an irony, a banal piece about a dancers couple – the way it is."
